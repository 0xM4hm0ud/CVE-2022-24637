This script is made to automate the CVE-2022-24637 vulnerability. I created this exploit for my Hackthebox machine vessel. https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Vessel

The exploit and idea is based on https://devel0pment.de/?p=2494


## exploit

Run the script with the following parameters:

`python3 exploit.py http://<url>/ newPassword YourIp YourPort`

It might be possible that you need to run it a few times to get a shell.

The script can be improved.
